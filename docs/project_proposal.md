### **Abstract**

We are concerned with global water quality in comparison to the United
States and how it fluctuates and stays the same. To address this
concern, we plan to seek out data that will give us a good idea of the
comparison between the global and national numbers so we can analyze the
differences and determine what factors led to the discrepancies. This is
an important concept because water quality remains a prevalent emerging
issue in numerous cities across the country such as Reno, Pomona, and
Arlington.

### Keywords

-   Improved water source

-   Unsafe water

-   Global equality to clean water

### Introduction

Our topic surrounds the issue of water quality in the United States and
global. Drinking water quality varies in each place, depending on the
condition of the water source it comes from and the treatment it
receives before becoming available to the public. In the U.S., there are
set standards such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that control the water quality and
assure that it is safe to consume. The SDWA includes guidelines for
drinking water quality, water testing schedules, and water testing
methods. Many states enforce their own drinking water standards that aim
to protect similar to the EPA's national standard.

### **Problem Domain**

-   [**Project Framing:**]{.underline}

Our project examines the US' water quality and systems in seeing what
factors and aspects contribute to the water systems and sanitation and
how that functions throughout the country. The data we look at spans
various areas and the quality of water, that we can utilize to further
examine what affects water sanitation in a certain region. Comparing the
US to other countries allows us to examine what contributes to water
sanitation and what policies and factors are in place in countries with
great water health compared to lower quality water.

The U.S.'s water quality is among the safest in the world, however,
there are many possible sources of contamination, that can lead to
health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive
problems, and neurological disorders. Young children, pregnant women,
and people with weaker immune systems are at risk for illness.

-   [**Human Values:**]{.underline}

Public health and safety are essential to society and for human
survival, aiming to improve our quality of life, helps children succeed,
and reduces human suffering. Water sanitation is an issue that falls
into the category of public health with a focus on community-wide
prevention and protection. Clean water and accessibility to clean water
are essential to human life, that is important to preserve and promote
to the best of our society's ability.

-   [**Stakeholders:**]{.underline}

Everyone is a stakeholder when it comes to a public health concern,
especially drinking water. Since water is a necessity for survival,
direct stakeholders to this issue include the general public, especially
people living in regions that do not have efficient water systems and in
areas that have a lower quality of water due to various factors.
Indirect stakeholders to this issue are future generations that are
reliant on high water quality to support their health and well-being.

-   [**Harms and Benefits:**]{.underline}

Possible benefits to high-quality water being available for everyone are
that individual health is always kept as a priority and that populations
across the globe are healthy and are able to maintain healthy lifestyles
that keep the rest of society functioning. Moreover, some harms that may
come from constructing better water systems and water quality are that
it is expensive and may negatively impact the economy, as well as it
different areas it may interfere with other environmental factors such
as land or wildlife.

### Research Questions

Our first research question is which factors caused the United States'
current standing in terms of global water quality? This is important
because if we are able to understand the reasons for this then we can
work towards changing that so we can drastically improve the water
quality. The motivation for the question is that the presence of
contaminants in cities around the U.S. has led to severe health issues
for the people living there so determining the leading factors is
essential. The second research question is how do socioeconomic factors
influence water quality in the U.S. and other countries? The reason that
this is important is because the social and economic aspects of this
major health problem have contributed heavily to it so now that we
identified the issues, it's easier to prevent them from influencing
water quality which is what motivates this inquiry. Our third research
question is why should we prioritize water quality as a serious
environmental issue on a local and global scale? This is important to
explore because there are numerous other issues to focus on and the
motivation for this is to understand the depth of this problem both
locally and globally.

### The Dataset

These three data sets provides global population data that has access to safe
drinking water, population percentage who doesn't have access, and lastly data
on the death rates from unsafe drinking water. These data sets are related to our research question,
"What factors cause the state of the water quality in the US?", as it
shows what factors are involved in each country for their current water
access/quality. The data set is provided/collected by WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation. The JMP
database has 5,000+ national data sources with information on WASH. This
includes nationally representative household surveys, censuses and
administrative reports. This data set includes data starting from the
year 2000 to 2020. Its purpose is to show global statistics of water
access and how they differ in different regions of the world.The JMP's
four main objectives for collecting data is as it states on their
official website, "The JMP strategy comprises four main objectives which
include consolidating its normative function and its role as a global
custodian of WASH data, further strengthening country support, and
promoting a more integrated approach to monitoring WASH and related
issues in collaboration with other agencies." The JMP is the leading
source when it comes to comparing estimates of progress at the global,
national and regional levels and also has a very extensive database
covering the globe which makes the JMP a very credible source for data.\

| Share Without Improved Water  | 5070           | 4                 | <https://ourworldindata.org/water-access> |
| Death Rates From Unsafe Water | 6841           | 4                 | <https://ourworldindata.org/water-access> |

### Limitations

The implications of global access to water relies heavily on politics,
and therefore
policymakers. Without global support and commitment, it is an impossible
mission
for one individual country, or even multiplecountries to accomplish. In
addition, technology advancements would make the push for access to
clean water much easier. With new advancements in sanitation or
cleaning water, it allows us to more efficiently andeconomically create
systems for clean water. For example, a system to process excreta or
urine would allow ether energy generation or a renewable water
source.

### Findings

A limitation of this data is that this data is from 2019.
Things could have changed between then and now, such as technological
advancements that would allow us to make exponentially faster progress.
There are also a some areas that data is not collected, but these are
not counted into the total at all. On the visuals, they are shown as
white. Another possible limitation is the arbitrary definitions of all
of
the classifications of accessibility, such as "basic",
"limited", and "improved". These may conflict or be different
than other reports and the definitions may be different.
