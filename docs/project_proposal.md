### **Abstract**

We are concerned with global water quality in comparison to the United
States and how it fluctuates and stays the same. To address this
concern, we plan to seek out data that will give us a good idea of the
comparison between the global and national numbers so we can analyze the
differences and determine what factors led to the discrepancies. This is
an important concept because water quality remains a prevalent emerging
issue in numerous cities across the country such as Reno, Pomona, and
Arlington.

### Keywords

-   Improved water source

-   Unsafe water

-   Global equality to clean water

### Introduction

Our topic surrounds the issue of water quality in the United States and
global. Drinking water quality varies in each place, depending on the
condition of the water source it comes from and the treatment it
receives before becoming available to the public. In the U.S., there are
set standards such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that control the water quality and
assure that it is safe to consume. The SDWA includes guidelines for
drinking water quality, water testing schedules, and water testing
methods. Many states enforce their own drinking water standards that aim
to protect similar to the EPA's national standard.

### **Problem Domain**

-   [**Project Framing:**]

Our project examines the US' water quality and systems in seeing what
factors and aspects contribute to the water systems and sanitation and
how that functions throughout the country. The data we look at spans
various areas and the quality of water, that we can utilize to further
examine what affects water sanitation in a certain region. Comparing the
US to other countries allows us to examine what contributes to water
sanitation and what policies and factors are in place in countries with
great water health compared to lower quality water.

The U.S.'s water quality is among the safest in the world, however,
there are many possible sources of contamination, that can lead to
health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive
problems, and neurological disorders. Young children, pregnant women,
and people with weaker immune systems are at risk for illness.

-   [**Human Values:**]

Public health and safety are essential to society and for human
survival, aiming to improve our quality of life, helps children succeed,
and reduces human suffering. Water sanitation is an issue that falls
into the category of public health with a focus on community-wide
prevention and protection. Clean water and accessibility to clean water
are essential to human life, that is important to preserve and promote
to the best of our society's ability.

-   [**Stakeholders:**]

Everyone is a stakeholder when it comes to a public health concern,
especially drinking water. Since water is a necessity for survival,
direct stakeholders to this issue include the general public, especially
people living in regions that do not have efficient water systems and in
areas that have a lower quality of water due to various factors.
Indirect stakeholders to this issue are future generations that are
reliant on high water quality to support their health and well-being.

-   [**Harms and Benefits:**]

Possible benefits to high-quality water being available for everyone are
that individual health is always kept as a priority and that populations
across the globe are healthy and are able to maintain healthy lifestyles
that keep the rest of society functioning. Moreover, some harms that may
come from constructing better water systems and water quality are that
it is expensive and may negatively impact the economy, as well as it
different areas it may interfere with other environmental factors such
as land or wildlife.

### Research Questions

What is the United States water access ranking compared to other countries?

This is important because if we are able to understand the reasons for this then we can work towards changing that so we can drastically improve the water quality throughout the country. The motivation for the question is that the presence of contaminants in cities around the U.S. has led to severe health issues for the people living there so determining the leading factors is essential.

 How does the US water ranking compare to Canadas?

The reason that this is important as through comparing the US to another country that is close in geographic location and similar socioeconomically, we are able to analyze the water health and further identify what is contributing to each country’s ranking and potentially create solutions to prevent those identified factors from influencing poor water quality.

What is the overall trend in deaths from poor water quality over the years?

This is important to explore because it examines a major impact of poorer water quality and sanitation systems, and emphasizes the need for reformed water quality standards, or other solutions that minimize the high counts of death from this issue. The motivation for this is to understand the depth of this problem both locally and globally.


### The Dataset

Our four datasets include data on access to drinking water, share of population without improved water sources, deaths by risk factors, and death rates from unsafe drinking water. We can answer our research question by using these datasets, “Which factors caused the United States' current standing in terms of global water quality? '' as it shows the standings of different water sanitation levels around the world. The dataset specifically, “Access to Drinking Water”, shows global data on the population’s water sanitation levels.The levels of water sanitation include Safely Managed (SM), Basic (Bas_minus_sm), Limited (Lim), Unimproved (Unimp), and lastly No access (Sur). These data sets are on the “Ourworldindata.org” website and the data is provided/collected by WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation. The JMP database has 5,000+ national data sources with information on WASH. This includes nationally representative household surveys, censuses and administrative reports. These datasets include global data starting from the year 2000 to 2020. The data’s purpose is to show global statistics of water access and how they differ across different regions of the globe are presented in this report. Listed on their official website, the JMP's four main objectives for collecting data regarding water sanitation and access is, "The JMP strategy comprises four main objectives which include consolidating its normative function and its role as a global custodian of WASH data, further strengthening country support, and promoting a more integrated approach to monitoring WASH and related issues in collaboration with other agencies." The JMP is the leading source when it comes to comparing estimates of progress at the global, national and regional levels and also has a very extensive database covering the globe thereby making the JMP an extremely reliable data source.

| Death Rates From Unsafe Water   | 6841           | 4                 | <https://ourworldindata.org/water-access> |
| Number of deaths by risk factors| 6841           | 31                | <https://ourworldindata.org/water-access> |

### Findings
From our research, we are able to see multiple patterns and examine various trends that occur from water sanitation and quality in the US, and compare that on a global scale.

What is the United States water access ranking compared to other countries?

In the most recent year (2020) of the dataset, The United States' safely managed water access ranks among the top compared to other countries. Although it is not 100 percent like some other countries,  it is close at 97.33 percent of the population having safely managed water access.

How does the US water ranking compare to Canadas?


What is the overall trend in deaths from poor water quality over the years?


### Discussion
Overall, the importance of this issue only increases with time, as water is essential need for survival, and many international organizations use access to safe drinking water and safely managed sanitation facilities as a measure of progress against poverty, disease, and death. As the CDC states, “Access to these services by every man, woman, and child is also considered a human right, not a privilege. Though progress has been made to provide safe drinking water and sanitation to people throughout the world, billions of people still lack access to these services every day.” Many countries face challenges in providing strong sanitation practices and infrastructures for their populations. Communities need to stay healthy in order for other aspects of society to function, and at an individual level, the healthier we are, our life expectancy can improve, and we are overall able to build a healthier, more sustainable environment for the current population as well as populations in the future. It greatly influences our health at an individual level, community level, and societal level, and is a huge determinant of how the world population is growing.  

Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries' economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction. Clean water and accessibility to clean water are essential to human life, that is important to preserve and promote to the best of our society's ability.

### Conclusion
Moreover, the global public health issue of water quality and sanitation remains a global health crisis. From a scientific perspective, research clearly states that a human being can survive more than three weeks without food, but where water is concerned most people cannot go days without it. Dehydration from lack of food and water is dangerous, thus emphasizing that water is a key necessity. Without it, our communities will not be able to survive. From our research and analysis, we are able to see how various countries stand in terms of water quality and sanitation, particularly focusing on the US as we know that there are several policies and standards such as the Safe Water Drinking Act so seeing this ranking aids in putting in to perspective the true state of the public health. Additionally, we are aware and want to emphasize that there are billions of people around the world who do not have access to clean drinking water.  

In developed nations, such as the US and Canada, clean water is considered natural and is a right, and most people from advanced countries such as these may not pay attention to the fact that access to clean water is a grave crisis around the world. There are still many nations that do not have access to clean water sources that are safe for human consumption, as according to the research done by the World Health Organization, “approximately 2.1 billion people all over the world still are unable to access safe water sources within their home.” Other research has indicated that in New York, USA, 8.3 million people were exposed to water contaminants in their drinking water that included viruses and various kinds of bacteria. Along with more than 63 million people in India alone have consumed water from unsafe sources, and in Nepal, 91% of the population is drinking water from sources that contain E-coli bacteria that cause dangerous infections. Overall, it is greatly important to preserve and promote clean water systems and accessibility to these systems to the best of our society's ability, now and in the future.
