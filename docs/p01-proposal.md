# Deviation in United States' Water Quality: Project Proposal

## Code name: *Contributors: Anumita Basani (Anumitab\@uw.edu), Diya Kumaran   (Diyak2\@uw.edu), Eddy Wong (Eddyw206\@hotmail.com), Daniel Zhang (Danielz6\@uw.edu)*

### *Autumn 2022*

### **Abstract**

We are concerned with global water quality in comparison to the United States and how it fluctuates and stays the same. To address this concern, we plan to seek out data that will give us a good idea of the comparison between the global and national numbers so we can analyze the differences and determine what factors led to the discrepancies. This is an important concept because water quality remains a prevalent emerging issue in numerous cities across the country such as Reno, Pomona, and Arlington.

### **Problem Domain**

-    \|Problem Domain \| Use short sub-sections to describe your topic
    and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including
    project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders,
    possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3.
    **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs
    to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press,
    reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.

### Research Questions

Our first research question is which factors caused the United States' current standing in terms of global water quality? This is important because if we are able to understand the reasons for this then we can work towards changing that so we can drastically improve the water quality. The motivation for the question is that the presence of contaminants in cities around the U.S. has led to severe health issues for the people living there so determining the leading factors is essential. The second research question is how do socioeconomic factors influence water quality in the U.S. and other countries? The reason that this is important is because the social and economic aspects of this major health problem have contributed heavily to it so now that we identified the issues, it's easier to prevent them from influencing water quality which is what motivates this inquiry. Our third research question is why should we prioritize water quality as a serious environmental issue on a local and global scale? This is important to explore because there are numerous other issues to focus on and the motivation for this is to understand the depth of this problem both locally and globally. 


### The Dataset

This data set provides global population data that has access to safe
and managed drinking water. This is related to our research question,
\"What factors cause the state of the water quality in the US?\", as it
shows what factors are involved in each country for their current water
access/quality. The data set is provided/collected by WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation. The JMP
database has 5,000+ national data sources with information on WASH. This
includes nationally representative household surveys, censuses and
administrative reports. This data set includes data starting from the
year 2000 to 2020. Its purpose is to show global statistics of water
access and how they differ in different regions of the world.The JMP\'s
four main objectives for collecting data is as it states on their
official website, \"The JMP strategy comprises four main objectives
which include consolidating its normative function and its role as a
global custodian of WASH data, further strengthening country support,
and promoting a more integrated approach to monitoring WASH and related
issues in collaboration with other agencies.\" The JMP is the leading
source when it comes to comparing estimates of progress at the global,
national and regional levels and also has a very extensive database
covering the globe which makes the JMP a very credible source for data.\
