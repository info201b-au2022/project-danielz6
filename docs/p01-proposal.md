### *INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington*

### *Autumn 2022*

### **Abstract**

-   \|Abstract \| Write a short abstract of three sentences. Your
    abstract should summarize your entire project, but only the very
    most important aspects. Here are two examples of how you might
    structure your abstract: **(1)** "Our main question is .... This
    question is important because .... To address the question, we will
    ...." and **(2)** "We are concerned with ..., because .... To
    address this concern, we plan to ...." \| \|Keywords \| 3-5 keywords
    that summarize your project. (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology;
    bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data")
    \|

### Keywords

-   Improved water source

-   Unsafe water

-   Global equality to clean water

### Introduction

Our topic surrounds the issue of water quality in the United
States and global. Drinking water quality varies in each place,
depending on
the condition of the water source it comes from and the treatment it
receives
before becoming available to the public. In the U.S., there are set
standards
such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)
regulations that control the water quality and assure that it is safe to
consume. The SDWA includes guidelines for drinking water quality, water
testing
schedules, and water testing methods. Many states enforce their own
drinking
water standards that aim to protect similar to the EPA\'s national
standard.

### 
**Problem Domain**

-   [**Project Framing:**]{.underline}

Our project examines the US\' water
quality and systems in seeing what factors and aspects contribute to the
water
systems and sanitation and how that functions throughout the country.
The data
we look at spans various areas and the quality of water, that we can
utilize to
further examine what affects water sanitation in a certain region.
Comparing
the US to other countries allows us to examine what contributes to water
sanitation and what policies and factors are in place in countries with
great
water health compared to lower quality water.

The U.S.\'s water quality is among
the safest in the world, however, there are many possible sources of
contamination, that can lead to health issues, including
gastrointestinal
illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Young
children,
pregnant women, and people with weaker immune systems are at risk for
illness.

-   [**Human Values:**]{.underline}

Public health and safety are essential to society and for human
survival, aiming to improve our quality of
life, helps children succeed, and reduces human suffering. Water
sanitation is
an issue that falls into the category of public health with a focus on
community-wide prevention and protection. Clean water and accessibility
to
clean water are essential to human life, that is important to preserve
and
promote to the best of our society\'s ability.

-   [**Stakeholders:**]{.underline}

Everyone is a stakeholder when it comes to a public health concern,
especially drinking water. Since water is a necessity for survival,
direct stakeholders to this issue include the general public, especially
people living in regions that do not have efficient water systems and in
areas that have a lower quality of water due to various factors.
Indirect stakeholders to this issue are future generations that are
reliant on high water quality to support their health and well-being.

-   [**Harms and Benefits:**]{.underline}

Possible benefits to high-quality
water being available for everyone are that individual health is always
kept as
a priority and that populations across the globe are healthy and are
able to
maintain healthy lifestyles that keep the rest of society functioning.
Moreover, some harms that may come from constructing better water
systems and
water quality are that it is expensive and may negatively impact the
economy,
as well as it different areas it may interfere with other environmental
factors
such as land or wildlife.

### Research Questions

-   \|Research Questions \| Present your 3-5 research questions. You
    should present each research question. For each research question,
    you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the
    question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions
    you would write about 200 words or more if needed.)

### The Dataset

This data set provides global population data that has access to safe
and managed drinking water. This is related to our research question,
\"What factors cause the state of the water quality in the US?\", as it
shows what factors are involved in each country for their current water
access/quality. The data set is provided/collected by WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation. The JMP
database has 5,000+ national data sources with information on WASH. This
includes nationally representative household surveys, censuses and
administrative reports. This data set includes data starting from the
year 2000 to 2020. Its purpose is to show global statistics of water
access and how they differ in different regions of the world.The JMP\'s
four main objectives for collecting data is as it states on their
official website, \"The JMP strategy comprises four main objectives
which include consolidating its normative function and its role as a
global custodian of WASH data, further strengthening country support,
and promoting a more integrated approach to monitoring WASH and related
issues in collaboration with other agencies.\" The JMP is the leading
source when it comes to comparing estimates of progress at the global,
national and regional levels and also has a very extensive database
covering the globe which makes the JMP a very credible source for data.\

### Implications

The implications of global access to water relies heavily on politics,
and therefore policymakers. Without global support and commitment, it is
an impossible mission for one individual country, or even multiple
countries to accomplish. In addition, technology advancements would make
the push for access to clean water much easier. With new advancements in
sanitation or cleaning water, it allows us to more efficiently and
economically create systems for clean water. For example, a system to
process excreta or urine would allow ether energy generation or a
renewable water source.

### Limitations

A limitation of this data is that this data is from 2019. Things could
have changed between then and now, such as technological advancements
that would allow us to make exponentially faster progress. There are
also a some areas that data is not collected, but these are not counted
into the total at all. On the visuals, they are shown as white. Another
possible limitation is the arbitrary definitions of all of the
classifications of accessibility, such as "basic", "limited", and
"improved". These may conflict or be different than other reports and
the definitions may be different.
