# Diviation in United States' Water Quality: Project Proposal

## Code name: *Contributors: Anumita Basani (Anumitab\@uw.edu), Diya Kumaran   (Diyak2\@uw.edu), Daniel Zhang (Danielz6\@uw.edu), Eddy*

### *INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington*

### *Autumn 2022*

### **Abstract**

-   \|Abstract \| Write a short abstract of three sentences. Your
    abstract should summarize your entire project, but only the very
    most important aspects. Here are two examples of how you might
    structure your abstract: **(1)** "Our main question is .... This
    question is important because .... To address the question, we will
    ...." and **(2)** "We are concerned with ..., because .... To
    address this concern, we plan to ...." \| \|Keywords \| 3-5 keywords
    that summarize your project. (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology;
    bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data")
    \| \|Introduction \| Briefly introduce your project. (About 150
    words.)

### **Problem Domain**

-    \|Problem Domain \| Use short sub-sections to describe your topic
    and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including
    project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders,
    possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3.
    **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs
    to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press,
    reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.
    (About 400 words.) \|

### Research Questions

-   \|Research Questions \| Present your 3-5 research questions. You
    should present each research question. For each research question,
    you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the
    question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions
    you would write about 200 words or more if needed.)

### The Dataset

-   \| \|The Dataset \| **(1)** Describe how your dataset is related to
    your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions.
    That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research
    questions? **(2)** Include a table that presents the name of each
    data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of
    variables (columns). **(3)** Include a full citation to each data
    file, including URL. **(4)** Finally, describe the provenance of
    your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected
    the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection
    effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?
    (c) How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and
    trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the
    source of the data? (About 400 words.) \| \|Expected Implications \|
    Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly
    describe the expected or possible implications for technologists,
    designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.) \|

### Limitations

-   \|Limitations \| Proposal only. What limitations might you need to
    address? Briefly discuss. (About 150 words.) \| \|*Findings* \| *Not
    for the project proposal; for final report only. Give answers to
    each of your research questions. (About 400 words.)* \|
    \|*Discussion* \| *Not for the project proposal; for final report
    only. Discuss importance and/or implications of your findings (About
    400 words.)* \| \|*Conclusion* \| *Not for the project proposal; for
    final report only. Give the reader a summary point, the key point
    that you will like your audience to leave with. (About 400 words.)*
    \| \|Acknowledgements \| Is there anyone you would like to thank? A
    librarian who helped you with your research? A Teaching Assistant? A
    friend who helped you find your data? Say thank you in this
    section.\| \|References \| Include your three or more research
    citations here. Also, include citations to your data files. Please
    use a standard citation style of your choice. See [Citing
    Sources](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations) at the UW
    Library. \| \|Appendix A: Questions\| Do you have questions for your
    TA or instructor? Include them here.\|
